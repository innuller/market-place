                INNULLER "tags" the contacts in your address book as your friends, but at
                any-time, you can review the list of your tagged friends and choose to
                untag any of them at any time. Untagging your contacts will hide your
                ratings from them and will also result in their ratings not being shown to
                you. Ratings would not indicate your relationship with the reviewer
                however ratings will be always shown on the platform.

                Only users of INNULLER will be displayed in your tagged friends list. If a

                platforms, the ratings associated with the contact will be displayed as
                part of your friends' ratings. If a contact in your address book has used
                INNULLER's service across any platform and has not rated an establishment,
                although their name is displayed in your friends list, no ratings will be
                shown associated with the said contact. If any of your tagged friends

                friend will be visible to you only if Your mobile number is present in his
                contacts list and You have not been untagged by your friend. It will be
